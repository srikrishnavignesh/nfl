# 📘 NFL Player Trajectory Prediction — Spatiotemporal Modeling (Kaggle Big Data Bowl 2026)

## 📌 Overview
This project is based on a Kaggle competition focused on predicting player positions in the NFL after the quarterback releases the ball.  
The challenge involves forecasting the next **N frames (on an average 11)** of movement for selected players using their past tracking data.

Player movement during a downfield pass is highly dynamic and uncertain — outcomes range from completions to interceptions. Understanding these trajectories helps the NFL analyze behavior of receivers, defenders, and passers during critical moments of a play.

---

## 🏈 Problem Description
During a pass play:

- The quarterback (QB) receives the snap.
- At the moment the ball is thrown, the prediction window begins.
- Tracking data provides positions and physical attributes for all players near the action.
- Not all 22 players are relevant — only those within the vicinity of the play (often 10–14 players).

### 🎯 Goal
Predict the **next N (20–40)** positions *(x, y)* for a subset of players (**P_pred ≤ P**) given:

- Their historical movement prior to the pass  
- Ball landing location  
- Player roles (Passer, Targeted Receiver, Defense, etc.)  
- Game- and play-level context  

---

## 📂 Input Features
Each frame includes tracking data before the pass is thrown:

- `game_id`: Game identifier, unique (numeric)  
- `play_id`: Play identifier, not unique across games (numeric)  
- `player_to_predict`: Whether or not the x/y prediction for this player will be scored (bool)  
- `nfl_id`: Player identification number, unique across players (numeric)  
- `frame_id`: Frame identifier for each play/type, starting at 1 for each game_id/play_id/file type (input or output) (numeric)  
- `play_direction`: Direction that the offense is moving (left or right)  
- `absolute_yardline_number`: Distance from end zone for possession team (numeric) (how far from the score zone)
- `player_name`: Player name (text)  
- `player_height`: Player height (ft-in)  
- `player_weight`: Player weight (lbs)  
- `player_birth_date`: Birth date (yyyy-mm-dd)

- `player_side`: Team player is on (Offense or Defense)  
- `player_role`: Role on the play (Defensive Coverage, Targeted Receiver, Passer, Other Route Runner)  
- `x`: Player position along the long axis of the field (0–120 yards)  
- `y`: Player position along the short axis of the field (0–53.3 yards)  
- `s`: Speed in yards/second (numeric)  
- `a`: Acceleration in yards/second² (numeric)  
- `o`: Orientation of player (degrees)  
- `dir`: Angle of player motion (degrees)  
- `num_frames_output`: Number of frames to predict in output data for the given game_id/play_id/nfl_id (numeric)  
- `ball_land_x`: Ball landing x-position (0–120 yards)  
- `ball_land_y`: Ball landing y-position (0–53.3 yards)

## 🛠 Feature Engineering

Feature engineering is performed using the `NFLFeatureTransformer` class, which normalizes numerical fields and adds several new features.

### 🔹 Angle-Based Features
-  
- `sin_dir`, `cos_dir`  
- `sin_o`, `cos_o`  
- `angle_between_ball_land_and_player`  
- `angle_between_ball_land_and_player_orient`  
- `sin_angle_between_ball_land_and_player`  
- `cos_angle_between_ball_land_and_player`  
- `sin_angle_between_ball_land_and_player_orient`  
- `cos_angle_between_ball_land_and_player_orient`  
- `sin_change_in_o` 
- `cos_change_in_o` 
- `change_in_dir`
- `sin_change_in_dir` 
- `cos_change_in_dir`
- `change_in_o`
- `angle_between_orientation_and_player`
       

These help the model understand relative direction and orientation with respect to the ball.

## 📁 Project files

- `gru.py` 
- `lightGBT.py` 

Each python file represents a separate modeling approach to the same prediction task.

## 🔷 Model 1: LightGBT

### 🧱 Architecture

This approach combines:

1. Takes the last given frame and uses that data to predict the next `num_frames_output`.
2. We predict the residual from the last known x and y positions.
3. Uses a separate model dx_model , dy_model to predict the residuals.


## 🔷 Model 2: RNN With Cross Attention and MLP

### 🧱 Architecture

This approach combines:

Uses Two Models to find dx , dy from the last known x and y positions.

1. **Spatial Encoder**  
   - Operates on `[T, P, din]`  
   - Captures relationships among players at a given time frame  

2. **GRU Layer**  
   - Operates on `[P, T, din]`  
   - Models temporal evolution for each player's trajectory  (taken only on the players to predict)
   - Takes cross attention with Spatial Encoder at each time t.

3. **MLP Layer**  
   - Operates on `[P*T, din]`  
   - outputs the change in displacment dx, dy


Input is fed as:

- `[P, T, din]`

Where:

- `P`: total players under focus  
- `T`: total time steps  
- `din`: input feature dimension  


### 📉 Loss Function

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

### 📊 Performance

- **RMSE: 1.71 yards** on physics first order linear exerpolation
